================================================================================

## [sjackman/linuxbrew-standalone](Dockerfile)

A [standalone Linuxbrew][] installation

This image installs Linuxbrew with a new GCC compiler, binutils and glibc tool
chain built using [Linuxbrew][] so that it does not use the compiler or
libraries of the host system.
